Configuration
=============

Most configuration can be done either in the Hue app or in the diyHue web UI.

Pairing diyHue with the Hue app
-------------------------------

To pair a new device to diyHue, first head to ``http://{IP_ADDRESS}/hue/linkbutton``. The default username is `Hue` with a password of `Hue` also. At this point you should open the Hue app on your phone and start searching for hubs. To speed this up you can click the `Help` button and then enter the IP address of your diyHue device. Once the bridge has been detected, click the green `Set up` button. At this point, the app will prompt you to press the link button on your Hue bridge. To do so, click the `Activate` button on the web page you loaded at the start. The Hue app should now prompt you through the rest of the setup. For specific details on how to setup specific lights, browse the lights section in the navigation bar to the left.

Configuration File
------------------

The entire configuration is saved in the ``config.json`` file. Changes to the bridge are saved in real time or every hour automatically. In case of state change of lights or sensors the configuration is not saved to avoid extensive writes to the SD card on Raspberry Pi's. If you want to save the configuration manually, you can do so by accessing ``http://{emualtor ip}/save``. If you want to manually edit the configuration file to change any king of resource, I recommend backing up the file first. In case the configuration file is corrupted, you can look for backups that are done automatically every Sunday night.

Adding lights
-------------

Depending on which lights you plan to use, the setup method will vary. For detailed setup instructions, please chose the correct type of light you wish to setup from the menu on the left.
