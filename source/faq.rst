Do I need a Phillips Hue Bridge to control genuine Phillips Hue bulbs with diyHue?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hue bulbs use the zigbee radios to comunicate so you either need a genuine Phillips Hue Bridge or a raspbee module.

My Phillips TV detects diyHue Bridge but I am unable establish a connection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the instructions for pairing. In addition it can help to disconnect your `Internet` for a short period to make sure the TV performs a local Network search instead of using remote API of Phillips.

What do I need to use IKEA Tradfri devices?
-------------------------------------------

IKEA Tradfri bulbs can be controlled when paired with an IKEA hub. If you wish to use IKEA switches then you must use the Raspbee module. This will enable you to control both the IKEA lights and switches without an IKEA hub.

App XYZ doesn't work!
---------------------

Not all apps for Phillips Hue work out of the box with diyHue. If you are unable to pair the app with diyHue automatically, try looking for a manual pair option in the app. If that fails then open an issue here on GitHub. We will try our best to to get your app to work but due to the lack of support for the remote API with diyHue, some apps will never work.

My Google Home / Google Assistant doesn't find diyHue!
------------------------------------------------------

Google Assistant uses the remote API to find your Hue bridge. The remote API is not supported by diyHue. At the moment it looks like it never will. However, don't despair. There is an option to get it to work. [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is software used to provide a unified hub for all your smart devices. It has support for diyHue and Google Assistant, so you can import your diyHue lights into Home Assistant and use Google Assistant to control them via Home Assistant. There are plenty of instructions on the Home Assistant website however details on Phillips Hue with home assistant can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/hue/) and details on Google Assistant [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/google_assistant/) If you need more help, ask on our Slack chat or on the Home Assistant forums.
